### A beginner-friendly Python project that helps me log, categorize, and analyze my monthly expenses, giving me a clear picture of where my money goes.


## ðŸ“Œ Project overview 

Learning the Python basics and applying them to something practical that allows me to:
- Record each expense with an item, amount, category, and is_necessary. 
- Organize spending into categories (Food, Transport, Utilities, Basic, Healthcare etc.)  
- Build financial awareness by showing where my money is going.



##  ðŸ›  What I Used

In building this project, I practiced and applied:

Variables â†’ to store expense details like amount, category, and date

Data Types â†’ numbers (int/float), text (strings), True (boolean) ,and dates

Data Structures â†’ lists to organize and group expenses, using indexing to sum up prices

This is my first step toward applying Python in real-life projects while improving my coding and financial tracking skills.
